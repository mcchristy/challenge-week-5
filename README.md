## About
The goal of this project was to create a day planner application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This application is designed using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The application should display the current date in the header and the body should contain a serious of sections for each hour of the day. Those sections should be color coded for the current time: past;white, present;red, future;green. When the user types into each hourly block, the text should be saved to local storage.
